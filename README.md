# Build It Bigger

This project consists of an Android app built with two flavors (free and paid) that uses
multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. 

The finished app will consist of four modules. 
	- A Java library that provides jokes
	- A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
	- An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
	- An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

You will need to create a Google Endpoint project and add the configuration file, called "google-services.json" to the app's root folder
